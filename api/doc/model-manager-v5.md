# ModelManager v5

ModelManagerAPI implements the model manager interface and is the concrete
  implementation of the api end point.
This API facade is available on controller connections.

To include ModelManagerV5 capabilities in your client, load it as
part of your facades, for instance:
```javascript
const {conn, logout} = await jujulib.connectAndLogin(url, credentials, {
  facades: [require('jujulib/api/facades/model-manager-v5')]
});
```
Facade methods at then accessible at `conn.facades.modelManager`.

Go back to [index](index.md).
