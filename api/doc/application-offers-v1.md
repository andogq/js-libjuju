# ApplicationOffers v1

OffersAPI implements the cross model interface and is the concrete
  implementation of the api end point.
This API facade is available on controller connections.

To include ApplicationOffersV1 capabilities in your client, load it as
part of your facades, for instance:
```javascript
const {conn, logout} = await jujulib.connectAndLogin(url, credentials, {
  facades: [require('jujulib/api/facades/application-offers-v1')]
});
```
Facade methods at then accessible at `conn.facades.applicationOffers`.

Go back to [index](index.md).
