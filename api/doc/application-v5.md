# Application v5

APIv5 provides the Application API facade for version 5.
This API facade is available on model connections.

To include ApplicationV5 capabilities in your client, load it as
part of your facades, for instance:
```javascript
const {conn, logout} = await jujulib.connectAndLogin(url, credentials, {
  facades: [require('jujulib/api/facades/application-v5')]
});
```
Facade methods at then accessible at `conn.facades.application`.

Go back to [index](index.md).
