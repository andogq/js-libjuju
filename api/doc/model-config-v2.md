# ModelConfig v2

ModelConfigAPIV2 is currently the latest.
This API facade is available on model connections.

To include ModelConfigV2 capabilities in your client, load it as
part of your facades, for instance:
```javascript
const {conn, logout} = await jujulib.connectAndLogin(url, credentials, {
  facades: [require('jujulib/api/facades/model-config-v2')]
});
```
Facade methods at then accessible at `conn.facades.modelConfig`.

Go back to [index](index.md).

## Methods
- [modelGet](#modelGetcallback)
- [modelSet](#modelSetargs-callback)
- [modelUnset](#modelUnsetargs-callback)
- [slaLevel](#slaLevelcallback)
- [sequences](#sequencescallback)
- [setSLALevel](#setSLALevelargs-callback)

## modelGet(callback)
ModelGet implements the server-side part of the model-config CLI command.

- *@param {Function} callback* Called when the response from Juju is available,
  the callback receives an error and the result. If there are no errors, the
  result is provided as an object like the following:
```javascript
{
  config: map[string]{
    value: anything,
    source: string
  }
}
```
- *@returns {Promise}* Rejected or resolved with the values normally passed to
  the callback when the callback is not provided.
  This allows this method to be awaited.

## modelSet(args, callback)
ModelSet implements the server-side part of the set-model-config CLI
    command.

- *@param {Object} args* Arguments to be provided to Juju, as an object like
  the following:
```javascript
{
  config: map[string]anything
}
```
- *@param {Function} callback* Called when the response from Juju is available,
  the callback receives an error or null if the operation succeeded.
- *@returns {Promise}* Rejected or resolved with the values normally passed to
  the callback when the callback is not provided.
  This allows this method to be awaited.

## modelUnset(args, callback)
ModelUnset implements the server-side part of the set-model-config CLI
    command.

- *@param {Object} args* Arguments to be provided to Juju, as an object like
  the following:
```javascript
{
  keys: []string
}
```
- *@param {Function} callback* Called when the response from Juju is available,
  the callback receives an error or null if the operation succeeded.
- *@returns {Promise}* Rejected or resolved with the values normally passed to
  the callback when the callback is not provided.
  This allows this method to be awaited.

## slaLevel(callback)
SLALevel returns the current sla level for the model.

- *@param {Function} callback* Called when the response from Juju is available,
  the callback receives an error and the result. If there are no errors, the
  result is provided as an object like the following:
```javascript
{
  error: {
    message: string,
    code: string,
    info: {
      macaroon: anything,
      macaroonPath: string
    }
  },
  result: string
}
```
- *@returns {Promise}* Rejected or resolved with the values normally passed to
  the callback when the callback is not provided.
  This allows this method to be awaited.

## sequences(callback)
Sequences returns the model's sequence names and next values.

- *@param {Function} callback* Called when the response from Juju is available,

  result is provided as an object like the following:
```javascript
{
  sequences: map[string]int
}
```
- *@returns {Promise}* Rejected or resolved with the values normally passed to

  This allows this method to be awaited.

## setSLALevel(args, callback)
SetSLALevel sets the sla level on the model.

- *@param {Object} args* Arguments to be provided to Juju, as an object like
