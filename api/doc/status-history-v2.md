# StatusHistory v2

API is the concrete implementation of the Pruner endpoint.
This API facade is available on model connections.

To include StatusHistoryV2 capabilities in your client, load it as
part of your facades, for instance:
```javascript
const {conn, logout} = await jujulib.connectAndLogin(url, credentials, {
  facades: [require('jujulib/api/facades/status-history-v2')]
});
```
Facade methods at then accessible at `conn.facades.statusHistory`.

Go back to [index](index.md).

## Methods
- [modelConfig](#modelConfigcallback)
- [prune](#pruneargs-callback)
- [watchForModelConfigChanges](#watchForModelConfigChangescallback)

## modelConfig(callback)
ModelConfig returns the current model's configuration.

- *@param {Function} callback* Called when the response from Juju is available,
  the callback receives an error and the result. If there are no errors, the
  result is provided as an object like the following:
```javascript
{
  config: map[string]anything
}
```
- *@returns {Promise}* Rejected or resolved with the values normally passed to
  the callback when the callback is not provided.
  This allows this method to be awaited.

## prune(args, callback)
Prune endpoint removes status history entries until only the ones newer
    than now - p.MaxHistoryTime remain and the history is smaller than
    p.MaxHistoryMB.

- *@param {Object} args* Arguments to be provided to Juju, as an object like
  the following:
```javascript
{
  maxHistoryTime: int,
  maxHistoryMb: int
}
```
- *@param {Function} callback* Called when the response from Juju is available,
  the callback receives an error or null if the operation succeeded.
- *@returns {Promise}* Rejected or resolved with the values normally passed to
  the callback when the callback is not provided.
  This allows this method to be awaited.

## watchForModelConfigChanges(callback)
WatchForModelConfigChanges returns a NotifyWatcher that observes changes to
    the model configuration. Note that although the NotifyWatchResult
    contains an Error field, it's not used because we are only returning a
    single watcher, so we use the regular error return.

- *@param {Function} callback* Called when the response from Juju is available,
  the callback receives an error and the result. If there are no errors, the
  result is provided as an object like the following:
```javascript
{
  notifywatcherid: string,
  error: {
    message: string,
    code: string,
    info: {
      macaroon: anything,
      macaroonPath: string
    }
  }
}
```
- *@returns {Promise}* Rejected or resolved with the values normally passed to
  the callback when the callback is not provided.
  This allows this method to be awaited.
