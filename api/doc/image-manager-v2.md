# ImageManager v2

ImageManagerAPI implements the ImageManager interface and is the concrete
  implementation of the api end point.
This API facade is available on model connections.

To include ImageManagerV2 capabilities in your client, load it as
part of your facades, for instance:
```javascript
const {conn, logout} = await jujulib.connectAndLogin(url, credentials, {
  facades: [require('jujulib/api/facades/image-manager-v2')]
});
```
Facade methods at then accessible at `conn.facades.imageManager`.

Go back to [index](index.md).
