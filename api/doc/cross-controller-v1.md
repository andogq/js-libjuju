# CrossController v1

CrossControllerAPI provides access to the CrossModelRelations API facade.
This API facade is available on controller connections.

To include CrossControllerV1 capabilities in your client, load it as
part of your facades, for instance:
```javascript
const {conn, logout} = await jujulib.connectAndLogin(url, credentials, {
  facades: [require('jujulib/api/facades/cross-controller-v1')]
});
```
Facade methods at then accessible at `conn.facades.crossController`.

Go back to [index](index.md).

## Methods
- [controllerInfo](#controllerInfocallback)
- [watchControllerInfo](#watchControllerInfocallback)

## controllerInfo(callback)
ControllerInfo returns the API info for the controller.

- *@param {Function} callback* Called when the response from Juju is available,
  the callback receives an error and the result. If there are no errors, the
  result is provided as an object like the following:
```javascript
{
  results: []{
    addresses: []string,
    cacert: string,
    error: {
      message: string,
      code: string,
      info: {
        macaroon: anything,
        macaroonPath: string
      }
    }
  }
}
```
- *@returns {Promise}* Rejected or resolved with the values normally passed to
  the callback when the callback is not provided.
  This allows this method to be awaited.

## watchControllerInfo(callback)
WatchControllerInfo creates a watcher that notifies when the API info for
    the controller changes.

- *@param {Function} callback* Called when the response from Juju is available,
  the callback receives an error and the result. If there are no errors, the
  result is provided as an object like the following:
```javascript
{
  results: []{
    notifywatcherid: string,
    error: {
      message: string,
      code: string,
      info: {
        macaroon: anything,
        macaroonPath: string
      }
    }
  }
}
```
- *@returns {Promise}* Rejected or resolved with the values normally passed to
  the callback when the callback is not provided.
  This allows this method to be awaited.
