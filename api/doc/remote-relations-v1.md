# RemoteRelations v1

RemoteRelationsAPI provides access to the RemoteRelations API facade.
This API facade is available on model connections.

To include RemoteRelationsV1 capabilities in your client, load it as
part of your facades, for instance:
```javascript
const {conn, logout} = await jujulib.connectAndLogin(url, credentials, {
  facades: [require('jujulib/api/facades/remote-relations-v1')]
});
```
Facade methods at then accessible at `conn.facades.remoteRelations`.

Go back to [index](index.md).
