# CrossModelRelations v1

CrossModelRelationsAPI provides access to the CrossModelRelations API facade.
This API facade is available on model connections.

To include CrossModelRelationsV1 capabilities in your client, load it as
part of your facades, for instance:
```javascript
const {conn, logout} = await jujulib.connectAndLogin(url, credentials, {
  facades: [require('jujulib/api/facades/cross-model-relations-v1')]
});
```
Facade methods at then accessible at `conn.facades.crossModelRelations`.

Go back to [index](index.md).

## publishIngressNetworkChanges(args, callback)
PublishIngressNetworkChanges publishes changes to the required ingress
    addresses to the model hosting the offer in the relation.

  the following:
```javascript
{
  changes: []{
    relationToken: string,
