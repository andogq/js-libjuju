# Logger v1

LoggerAPI implements the Logger interface and is the concrete implementation
  of the api end point.
This API facade is available on model connections.

To include LoggerV1 capabilities in your client, load it as
part of your facades, for instance:
```javascript
const {conn, logout} = await jujulib.connectAndLogin(url, credentials, {
  facades: [require('jujulib/api/facades/logger-v1')]
});
```
Facade methods at then accessible at `conn.facades.logger`.

Go back to [index](index.md).

## Methods
- [loggingConfig](#loggingConfigargs-callback)
- [watchLoggingConfig](#watchLoggingConfigargs-callback)

## loggingConfig(args, callback)
LoggingConfig reports the logging configuration for the agents specified.

- *@param {Object} args* Arguments to be provided to Juju, as an object like
  the following:
```javascript
{
  entities: []{
    tag: string
  }
}
```
- *@param {Function} callback* Called when the response from Juju is available,
  the callback receives an error and the result. If there are no errors, the
  result is provided as an object like the following:
```javascript
{
  results: []{
    error: {
      message: string,
      code: string,
      info: {
        macaroon: anything,
        macaroonPath: string
      }
    },
    result: string
  }
}
```
- *@returns {Promise}* Rejected or resolved with the values normally passed to
  the callback when the callback is not provided.
  This allows this method to be awaited.

## watchLoggingConfig(args, callback)
WatchLoggingConfig starts a watcher to track changes to the logging config
    for the agents specified..  Unfortunately the current infrastruture
    makes watching parts of the config non-trivial, so currently any change
    to the config will cause the watcher to notify the client.

- *@param {Object} args* Arguments to be provided to Juju, as an object like
  the following:
```javascript
{
  entities: []{
    tag: string
  }
}
```
- *@param {Function} callback* Called when the response from Juju is available,
  the callback receives an error and the result. If there are no errors, the
  result is provided as an object like the following:
```javascript
{
  results: []{
    notifywatcherid: string,
    error: {
      message: string,
      code: string,
      info: {
        macaroon: anything,
        macaroonPath: string
      }
    }
  }
}
```
- *@returns {Promise}* Rejected or resolved with the values normally passed to
  the callback when the callback is not provided.
  This allows this method to be awaited.
