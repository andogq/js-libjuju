# MeterStatus v1

MeterStatusAPI implements the MeterStatus interface and is the concrete
  implementation of the API endpoint.
This API facade is available on model connections.

To include MeterStatusV1 capabilities in your client, load it as
part of your facades, for instance:
```javascript
const {conn, logout} = await jujulib.connectAndLogin(url, credentials, {
  facades: [require('jujulib/api/facades/meter-status-v1')]
});
```
Facade methods at then accessible at `conn.facades.meterStatus`.

Go back to [index](index.md).

## Methods
- [getMeterStatus](#getMeterStatusargs-callback)
- [watchMeterStatus](#watchMeterStatusargs-callback)

## getMeterStatus(args, callback)
GetMeterStatus returns meter status information for each unit.

- *@param {Object} args* Arguments to be provided to Juju, as an object like
  the following:
```javascript
{
  entities: []{
    tag: string
  }
}
```
- *@param {Function} callback* Called when the response from Juju is available,
  the callback receives an error and the result. If there are no errors, the
  result is provided as an object like the following:
```javascript
{
  results: []{
    code: string,
    info: string,
    error: {
      message: string,
      code: string,
      info: {
        macaroon: anything,
        macaroonPath: string
      }
    }
  }
}
```
- *@returns {Promise}* Rejected or resolved with the values normally passed to
  the callback when the callback is not provided.
  This allows this method to be awaited.

## watchMeterStatus(args, callback)
WatchMeterStatus returns a NotifyWatcher for observing changes to each
    unit's meter status.

- *@param {Object} args* Arguments to be provided to Juju, as an object like
  the following:
```javascript
{
  entities: []{
    tag: string
  }
}
```
- *@param {Function} callback* Called when the response from Juju is available,
  the callback receives an error and the result. If there are no errors, the
  result is provided as an object like the following:
```javascript
{
  results: []{
    notifywatcherid: string,
    error: {
      message: string,
      code: string,
      info: {
        macaroon: anything,
        macaroonPath: string
