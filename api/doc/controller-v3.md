# Controller v3

ControllerAPIv3 provides the v3 Controller API.
This API facade is available on controller connections.

To include ControllerV3 capabilities in your client, load it as
part of your facades, for instance:
```javascript
const {conn, logout} = await jujulib.connectAndLogin(url, credentials, {
  facades: [require('jujulib/api/facades/controller-v3')]
});
```
Facade methods at then accessible at `conn.facades.controller`.

Go back to [index](index.md).

## watch(callback)

Watch changes in the all models on this controller, and call the provided
callback every time changes arrive.
