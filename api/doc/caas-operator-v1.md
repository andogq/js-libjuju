# CAASOperator v1

There is no documentation for this facade.
This API facade is available on model connections.

To include CAASOperatorV1 capabilities in your client, load it as
part of your facades, for instance:
```javascript
const {conn, logout} = await jujulib.connectAndLogin(url, credentials, {
  facades: [require('jujulib/api/facades/caas-operator-v1')]
});
```
Facade methods at then accessible at `conn.facades.caasOperator`.

Go back to [index](index.md).
