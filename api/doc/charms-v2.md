part of your facades, for instance:
```javascript
const {conn, logout} = await jujulib.connectAndLogin(url, credentials, {
  facades: [require('jujulib/api/facades/charms-v2')]
});
```
Facade methods at then accessible at `conn.facades.charms`.

Go back to [index](index.md).

## Methods
- [charmInfo](#charmInfoargs-callback)
- [isMetered](#isMeteredargs-callback)
- [list](#listargs-callback)

```
- *@param {Function} callback* Called when the response from Juju is available,
