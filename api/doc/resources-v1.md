# Resources v1

Facade is the public API facade for resources.
This API facade is available on model connections.

To include ResourcesV1 capabilities in your client, load it as
part of your facades, for instance:
```javascript
const {conn, logout} = await jujulib.connectAndLogin(url, credentials, {
  facades: [require('jujulib/api/facades/resources-v1')]
});
```
Facade methods at then accessible at `conn.facades.resources`.

Go back to [index](index.md).

## Methods
- [addPendingResources](#addPendingResourcesargs-callback)
- [listResources](#listResourcesargs-callback)

## addPendingResources(args, callback)
AddPendingResources adds the provided resources (info) to the Juju model in
    a pending state, meaning they are not available until resolved.

- *@param {Object} args* Arguments to be provided to Juju, as an object like
  the following:
```javascript
{
  entity: {
    tag: string
  },
  addcharmwithauthorization: {
    url: string,
    channel: string,
    macaroon: anything,
    force: bool
  },
  resources: []{
    name: string,
    type: string,
    path: string,
    description: string,
    origin: string,
    revision: int,
    fingerprint: []int,
    size: int
  }
}
```
- *@param {Function} callback* Called when the response from Juju is available,
  the callback receives an error and the result. If there are no errors, the
  result is provided as an object like the following:
```javascript
{
  errorresult: {
    error: {
      message: string,
      code: string,
      info: {
        macaroon: anything,
        macaroonPath: string
      }
    }
  },
  pendingIds: []string
}
```
- *@returns {Promise}* Rejected or resolved with the values normally passed to
  the callback when the callback is not provided.
  This allows this method to be awaited.

## listResources(args, callback)
ListResources returns the list of resources for the given application.

- *@param {Object} args* Arguments to be provided to Juju, as an object like
  the following:
```javascript
{
  entities: []{
    tag: string
  }
}
```
- *@param {Function} callback* Called when the response from Juju is available,
  the callback receives an error and the result. If there are no errors, the
  result is provided as an object like the following:
```javascript
{
  results: []{
    errorresult: {
      error: {
        message: string,
        code: string,
        info: {
          macaroon: anything,
          macaroonPath: string
        }
      }
    },
    resources: []{
      charmresource: {
        name: string,
        type: string,
        path: string,
        description: string,
        origin: string,
        revision: int,
        fingerprint: []int,
        size: int
      },
      id: string,
      pendingId: string,
      application: string,
      username: string,
      timestamp: time
    },
    charmStoreResources: []{
      name: string,
      type: string,
      path: string,
      description: string,
      origin: string,
      revision: int,
      fingerprint: []int,
      size: int
    },
    unitResources: []{
      entity: {
        tag: string
      },
      resources: []{
        charmresource: {
          name: string,
          type: string,
          path: string,
          description: string,
          origin: string,
          revision: int,
          fingerprint: []int,
          size: int
        },
        id: string,
        pendingId: string,
        application: string,
        username: string,
        timestamp: time
      },
      downloadProgress: map[string]int
    }
  }
}
```
- *@returns {Promise}* Rejected or resolved with the values normally passed to
  the callback when the callback is not provided.
  This allows this method to be awaited.
