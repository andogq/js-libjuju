# Bundle v2

APIv2 provides the Bundle API facade for version 2.
This API facade is available on both controller and model connections.

To include BundleV2 capabilities in your client, load it as
part of your facades, for instance:
```javascript
const {conn, logout} = await jujulib.connectAndLogin(url, credentials, {
  facades: [require('jujulib/api/facades/bundle-v2')]
});
```
Facade methods at then accessible at `conn.facades.bundle`.

Go back to [index](index.md).

## Methods
- [exportBundle](#exportBundlecallback)
- [getChanges](#getChangesargs-callback)

## exportBundle(callback)
ExportBundle exports the current model configuration as bundle.

- *@param {Function} callback* Called when the response from Juju is available,
  the callback receives an error and the result. If there are no errors, the
  result is provided as an object like the following:
```javascript
{
  error: {
    message: string,
    code: string,
    info: {
      macaroon: anything,
      macaroonPath: string
    }
  },
  result: string
}
```
- *@returns {Promise}* Rejected or resolved with the values normally passed to
  the callback when the callback is not provided.
  This allows this method to be awaited.

## getChanges(args, callback)
GetChanges returns the list of changes required to deploy the given bundle
    data. The changes are sorted by requirements, so that they can be
    applied in order.

- *@param {Object} args* Arguments to be provided to Juju, as an object like
  the following:
```javascript
{
  yaml: string,
  bundleurl: string
}
```
- *@param {Function} callback* Called when the response from Juju is available,
  the callback receives an error and the result. If there are no errors, the
  result is provided as an object like the following:
```javascript
{
  changes: []{
    id: string,
    method: string,
    args: []anything,
    requires: []string
  },
  errors: []string
}
```
- *@returns {Promise}* Rejected or resolved with the values normally passed to
  the callback when the callback is not provided.
  This allows this method to be awaited.
