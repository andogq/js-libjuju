# UnitAssigner v1

API implements the functionality for assigning units to machines.
This API facade is available on model connections.

To include UnitAssignerV1 capabilities in your client, load it as
part of your facades, for instance:
```javascript
const {conn, logout} = await jujulib.connectAndLogin(url, credentials, {
  facades: [require('jujulib/api/facades/unit-assigner-v1')]
});
```
Facade methods at then accessible at `conn.facades.unitAssigner`.

Go back to [index](index.md).

## Methods
- [assignUnits](#assignUnitsargs-callback)
- [setAgentStatus](#setAgentStatusargs-callback)
- [watchUnitAssignments](#watchUnitAssignmentscallback)

## assignUnits(args, callback)
 AssignUnits assigns the units with the given ids to the correct machine.
    The  error results are returned in the same order as the given
    entities.

- *@param {Object} args* Arguments to be provided to Juju, as an object like
  the following:
```javascript
{
  entities: []{
    tag: string
  }
}
```
- *@param {Function} callback* Called when the response from Juju is available,
  the callback receives an error and the result. If there are no errors, the
  result is provided as an object like the following:
```javascript
{
  results: []{
    error: {
      message: string,
      code: string,
      info: {
        macaroon: anything,
        macaroonPath: string
      }
    }
  }
}
```
- *@returns {Promise}* Rejected or resolved with the values normally passed to
  the callback when the callback is not provided.
  This allows this method to be awaited.

## setAgentStatus(args, callback)
SetAgentStatus will set status for agents of Units passed in args, if one

    data: map[string]anything
  }
}
```
- *@param {Function} callback* Called when the response from Juju is available,
  the callback receives an error and the result. If there are no errors, the
  result is provided as an object like the following:
```javascript
{
  results: []{
    error: {
      message: string,
