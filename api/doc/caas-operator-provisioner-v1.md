# CAASOperatorProvisioner v1

There is no documentation for this facade.
This API facade is available on model connections.

To include CAASOperatorProvisionerV1 capabilities in your client, load it as
part of your facades, for instance:
```javascript
const {conn, logout} = await jujulib.connectAndLogin(url, credentials, {
  facades: [require('jujulib/api/facades/caas-operator-provisioner-v1')]
});
```
Facade methods at then accessible at `conn.facades.caasOperatorProvisioner`.

Go back to [index](index.md).

## Methods
- [apiAddresses](#apiAddressescallback)
- [apiHostPorts](#apiHostPortscallback)
- [life](#lifeargs-callback)
- [modelUUID](#modelUUIDcallback)
- [operatorProvisioningInfo](#operatorProvisioningInfocallback)
- [setPasswords](#setPasswordsargs-callback)
- [watchAPIHostPorts](#watchAPIHostPortscallback)
- [watchApplications](#watchApplicationscallback)

## apiAddresses(callback)
APIAddresses returns the list of addresses used to connect to the API.

- *@param {Function} callback* Called when the response from Juju is available,
  the callback receives an error and the result. If there are no errors, the
