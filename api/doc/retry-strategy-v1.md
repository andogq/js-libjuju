# RetryStrategy v1

RetryStrategyAPI implements RetryStrategy
This API facade is available on model connections.

To include RetryStrategyV1 capabilities in your client, load it as
part of your facades, for instance:
```javascript
const {conn, logout} = await jujulib.connectAndLogin(url, credentials, {
  facades: [require('jujulib/api/facades/retry-strategy-v1')]
});
```
Facade methods at then accessible at `conn.facades.retryStrategy`.

Go back to [index](index.md).

## Methods
- [retryStrategy](#retryStrategyargs-callback)
- [watchRetryStrategy](#watchRetryStrategyargs-callback)

## retryStrategy(args, callback)
RetryStrategy returns RetryStrategyResults that can be used by any code
    that uses to configure the retry timer that's currently in juju utils.

- *@param {Object} args* Arguments to be provided to Juju, as an object like
  the following:
```javascript
{
  entities: []{
    tag: string
  }
}
```
- *@param {Function} callback* Called when the response from Juju is available,
  the callback receives an error and the result. If there are no errors, the
  result is provided as an object like the following:
```javascript
{
  results: []{
    error: {
      message: string,
      code: string,
      info: {
        macaroon: anything,
        macaroonPath: string
      }
    },
    result: {
      shouldRetry: bool,
      minRetryTime: int,
      maxRetryTime: int,
      jitterRetryTime: bool,
      retryTimeFactor: int
    }
  }
}
```
- *@returns {Promise}* Rejected or resolved with the values normally passed to
  the callback when the callback is not provided.
  This allows this method to be awaited.

## watchRetryStrategy(args, callback)
WatchRetryStrategy watches for changes to the model. Currently we only
    allow changes to the boolean that determines whether retries should be
    attempted or not.

- *@param {Object} args* Arguments to be provided to Juju, as an object like
  the following:
```javascript
{
  entities: []{
    tag: string
  }
}
```
- *@param {Function} callback* Called when the response from Juju is available,
  the callback receives an error and the result. If there are no errors, the
  result is provided as an object like the following:
```javascript
{
  results: []{
    notifywatcherid: string,
    error: {
      message: string,
      code: string,
      info: {
        macaroon: anything,
        macaroonPath: string
      }
    }
  }
}
```
- *@returns {Promise}* Rejected or resolved with the values normally passed to
  the callback when the callback is not provided.
  This allows this method to be awaited.
