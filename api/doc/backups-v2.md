# Backups v2

APIv2 serves backup-specific API methods for version 2.
This API facade is available on model connections.

To include BackupsV2 capabilities in your client, load it as
part of your facades, for instance:
```javascript
const {conn, logout} = await jujulib.connectAndLogin(url, credentials, {
  facades: [require('jujulib/api/facades/backups-v2')]
});
```
Facade methods at then accessible at `conn.facades.backups`.

Go back to [index](index.md).
