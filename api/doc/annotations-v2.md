# Annotations v2

API implements the service interface and is the concrete implementation of
  the api end point.
This API facade is available on model connections.

To include AnnotationsV2 capabilities in your client, load it as
part of your facades, for instance:
```javascript
const {conn, logout} = await jujulib.connectAndLogin(url, credentials, {
  facades: [require('jujulib/api/facades/annotations-v2')]
});
```
Facade methods at then accessible at `conn.facades.annotations`.

Go back to [index](index.md).

## Methods
- [get](#getargs-callback)
- [set](#setargs-callback)

## get(args, callback)
Get returns annotations for given entities. If annotations cannot be
    retrieved for a given entity, an error is returned. Each entity is
    treated independently and, hence, will fail or succeed independently.

- *@param {Object} args* Arguments to be provided to Juju, as an object like
  the following:
```javascript
{
  entities: []{
    tag: string
  }
}
```
- *@param {Function} callback* Called when the response from Juju is available,
  the callback receives an error and the result. If there are no errors, the
  result is provided as an object like the following:
```javascript
{
  results: []{
    entity: string,
    annotations: map[string]string,
    error: {
      error: {
        message: string,
        code: string,
        info: {
          macaroon: anything,
          macaroonPath: string
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
- *@returns {Promise}* Rejected or resolved with the values normally passed to
  the callback when the callback is not provided.
  This allows this method to be awaited.

## set(args, callback)
Set stores annotations for given entities

- *@param {Object} args* Arguments to be provided to Juju, as an object like
  the following:
```javascript
{
  annotations: []{
    entity: string,
    annotations: map[string]string
  }
}
```
- *@param {Function} callback* Called when the response from Juju is available,
  the callback receives an error and the result. If there are no errors, the
  result is provided as an object like the following:
```javascript
{
  results: []{
    error: {
      message: string,
      code: string,
      info: {
        macaroon: anything,
        macaroonPath: string
      }
    }
  }
}
```
- *@returns {Promise}* Rejected or resolved with the values normally passed to
  the callback when the callback is not provided.
  This allows this method to be awaited.
