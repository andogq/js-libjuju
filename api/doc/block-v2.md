# Block v2

API implements Block interface and is the concrete implementation of the api
  end point.
This API facade is available on model connections.

To include BlockV2 capabilities in your client, load it as
part of your facades, for instance:
```javascript
const {conn, logout} = await jujulib.connectAndLogin(url, credentials, {
  facades: [require('jujulib/api/facades/block-v2')]
});
```
Facade methods at then accessible at `conn.facades.block`.

Go back to [index](index.md).

## Methods
- [list](#listcallback)
- [switchBlockOff](#switchBlockOffargs-callback)
- [switchBlockOn](#switchBlockOnargs-callback)

## list(callback)
List implements Block.List().

- *@param {Function} callback* Called when the response from Juju is available,
  the callback receives an error and the result. If there are no errors, the
  result is provided as an object like the following:
```javascript
{
  results: []{
    result: {
      id: string,
      tag: string,
      type: string,
      message: string
    },
    error: {
      message: string,
      code: string,
      info: {
        macaroon: anything,
        macaroonPath: string
      }
    }
  }
}
```
- *@returns {Promise}* Rejected or resolved with the values normally passed to
  the callback when the callback is not provided.
  This allows this method to be awaited.

## switchBlockOff(args, callback)
SwitchBlockOff implements Block.SwitchBlockOff().

- *@param {Object} args* Arguments to be provided to Juju, as an object like
  the following:
```javascript
{
  type: string,
  message: string

```
- *@param {Function} callback* Called when the response from Juju is available,
  the callback receives an error and the result. If there are no errors, the

  error: {
    message: string,
    code: string,

      macaroonPath: string
    }
