# UpgradeSeries v1

API serves methods required by the machine agent upgrade-series worker.
This API facade is available on model connections.

To include UpgradeSeriesV1 capabilities in your client, load it as
part of your facades, for instance:
```javascript
const {conn, logout} = await jujulib.connectAndLogin(url, credentials, {
  facades: [require('jujulib/api/facades/upgrade-series-v1')]
});
```
Facade methods at then accessible at `conn.facades.upgradeSeries`.

Go back to [index](index.md).

## finishUpgradeSeries(args, callback)
FinishUpgradeSeries is the last action in the upgrade workflow and is
    called after all machine and unit statuses are "completed". It updates
    the machine series to reflect the completed upgrade, then removes the
    upgrade-series lock.
