# ResourcesHookContext v1

UnitFacade is the resources portion of the uniter's API facade.
This API facade is available on model connections.

To include ResourcesHookContextV1 capabilities in your client, load it as
part of your facades, for instance:
```javascript
const {conn, logout} = await jujulib.connectAndLogin(url, credentials, {
  facades: [require('jujulib/api/facades/resources-hook-context-v1')]
});
```
Facade methods at then accessible at `conn.facades.resourcesHookContext`.

Go back to [index](index.md).

## Methods
- [getResourceInfo](#getResourceInfoargs-callback)

## getResourceInfo(args, callback)
GetResourceInfo returns the resource info for each of the given resource
    names (for the implicit application). If any one is missing then the
    corresponding result is set with errors.NotFound.

- *@param {Object} args* Arguments to be provided to Juju, as an object like
  the following:
```javascript
{
  resourceNames: []string
}
```
- *@param {Function} callback* Called when the response from Juju is available,
  the callback receives an error and the result. If there are no errors, the
  result is provided as an object like the following:
```javascript
{
  errorresult: {
    error: {
      message: string,
      code: string,
      info: {
        macaroon: anything,
        macaroonPath: string
      }
    }
  },
  resources: []{
    errorresult: {
      error: {
        message: string,
        code: string,
        info: {
          macaroon: anything,
          macaroonPath: string
        }
      }
    },
    resource: {
      charmresource: {
        name: string,
        type: string,
        path: string,
        description: string,
        origin: string,
        revision: int,
        fingerprint: []int,
        size: int
      },
      id: string,
      pendingId: string,
      application: string,
      username: string,
      timestamp: time
    }
  }
}
```
- *@returns {Promise}* Rejected or resolved with the values normally passed to
  the callback when the callback is not provided.
  This allows this method to be awaited.
