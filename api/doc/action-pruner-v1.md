# ActionPruner v1

There is no documentation for this facade.
This API facade is available on model connections.

To include ActionPrunerV1 capabilities in your client, load it as
part of your facades, for instance:
```javascript
const {conn, logout} = await jujulib.connectAndLogin(url, credentials, {
  facades: [require('jujulib/api/facades/action-pruner-v1')]
});
```
Facade methods at then accessible at `conn.facades.actionPruner`.

Go back to [index](index.md).

## Methods
- [modelConfig](#modelConfigcallback)
- [prune](#pruneargs-callback)
- [watchForModelConfigChanges](#watchForModelConfigChangescallback)

## modelConfig(callback)
ModelConfig returns the current model's configuration.

- *@param {Function} callback* Called when the response from Juju is available,
  the callback receives an error and the result. If there are no errors, the
  result is provided as an object like the following:
```javascript
{
  config: map[string]anything
}
```
- *@returns {Promise}* Rejected or resolved with the values normally passed to
  the callback when the callback is not provided.
  This allows this method to be awaited.

## prune(args, callback)
There is no documentation for this method.

- *@param {Object} args* Arguments to be provided to Juju, as an object like
  the following:
```javascript
{
  maxHistoryTime: int,
  maxHistoryMb: int
}
```
- *@param {Function} callback* Called when the response from Juju is available,
  the callback receives an error or null if the operation succeeded.
- *@returns {Promise}* Rejected or resolved with the values normally passed to
  the callback when the callback is not provided.
  This allows this method to be awaited.

## watchForModelConfigChanges(callback)
WatchForModelConfigChanges returns a NotifyWatcher that observes changes to
    the model configuration. Note that although the NotifyWatchResult
    contains an Error field, it's not used because we are only returning a
    single watcher, so we use the regular error return.

- *@param {Function} callback* Called when the response from Juju is available,
  the callback receives an error and the result. If there are no errors, the
  result is provided as an object like the following:
```javascript
{
  notifywatcherid: string,
  error: {
    message: string,
    code: string,
    info: {
      macaroon: anything,
      macaroonPath: string
    }
  }
}
```
- *@returns {Promise}* Rejected or resolved with the values normally passed to
  the callback when the callback is not provided.
  This allows this method to be awaited.
