# Admin v3

admin is the only object that unlogged-in clients can access. It holds any
  methods that are needed to log in.
This API facade is available on both controller and model connections.

To include AdminV3 capabilities in your client, load it as
part of your facades, for instance:
```javascript
const {conn, logout} = await jujulib.connectAndLogin(url, credentials, {
  facades: [require('jujulib/api/facades/admin-v3')]
});
```
Facade methods at then accessible at `conn.facades.admin`.

Go back to [index](index.md).

## Methods
- [redirectInfo](#redirectInfocallback) (helper / overridden)
- [login](#loginargs-callback)

## redirectInfo(callback)

RedirectInfo returns redirected host information for the model. In Juju it
always returns an error because the Juju controller does not multiplex
controllers.

- *@param {Function} callback* Called when the response from Juju is available,
  the callback receives an error and the result. If there are no errors,
  the result is provided as an object like the following:
```javascript
{
  servers: []{
    value: string,
    type: string,
    scope: string,
    port: string
  },
  caCert: string
}
```
- *@return {Promise}* Rejected or resolved with the values normally passed to
  the callback when the callback is not provided.
  This allows this method to be awaited.


## login(args, callback)
Login logs in with the provided credentials.  All subsequent requests on
    the connection will act as the authenticated user.

- *@param {Object} args* Arguments to be provided to Juju, as an object like
  the following:
```javascript
{
  authTag: string,
  credentials: string,
  nonce: string,
  macaroons: [][]anything,
  cliArgs: string,
  userData: string
}
```
- *@param {Function} callback* Called when the response from Juju is available,
  the callback receives an error and the result. If there are no errors, the
  result is provided as an object like the following:
```javascript
{
  dischargeRequired: anything,
  dischargeRequiredError: string,
  servers: [][]{
    address: {
      value: string,
      type: string,
      scope: string,
      spaceName: string
    },
    port: int
  },
  publicDnsName: string,
  modelTag: string,
  controllerTag: string,
  userInfo: {
    displayName: string,
    identity: string,
    lastConnection: time,
    credentials: string,
    controllerAccess: string,
    modelAccess: string
  },
  facades: []{
    name: string,
    versions: []int
  },
  serverVersion: string
}
```
- *@returns {Promise}* Rejected or resolved with the values normally passed to
  the callback when the callback is not provided.
  This allows this method to be awaited.
