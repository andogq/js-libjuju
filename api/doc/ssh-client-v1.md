# SSHClient v1

Facade implements the API required by the sshclient worker.
This API facade is available on model connections.

To include SSHClientV1 capabilities in your client, load it as
part of your facades, for instance:
```javascript
const {conn, logout} = await jujulib.connectAndLogin(url, credentials, {
  facades: [require('jujulib/api/facades/ssh-client-v1')]
});
```
Facade methods at then accessible at `conn.facades.sshClient`.

Go back to [index](index.md).

## Methods
- [allAddresses](#allAddressesargs-callback)
- [privateAddress](#privateAddressargs-callback)
- [proxy](#proxycallback)
- [publicAddress](#publicAddressargs-callback)
- [publicKeys](#publicKeysargs-callback)

## allAddresses(args, callback)
AllAddresses reports all addresses that might have SSH listening for each
    given entity in args. Machines and units are supported as entity types.
    TODO(wpk): 2017-05-17 This is a temporary solution, we should not fetch
    environ here but get the addresses from state. We will be changing it
    since we want to have space-aware SSH settings.

- *@param {Object} args* Arguments to be provided to Juju, as an object like
  the following:
```javascript
{
  entities: []{
    tag: string
  }
}
```
- *@param {Function} callback* Called when the response from Juju is available,
  the callback receives an error and the result. If there are no errors, the
  result is provided as an object like the following:
```javascript
{
  results: []{
    error: {
      message: string,
      code: string,
      info: {
        macaroon: anything,
        macaroonPath: string
      }
    },
    addresses: []string
  }
}
```
- *@returns {Promise}* Rejected or resolved with the values normally passed to
  the callback when the callback is not provided.
  This allows this method to be awaited.

## privateAddress(args, callback)
PrivateAddress reports the preferred private network address for one or
    more entities. Machines and units are supported.

- *@param {Object} args* Arguments to be provided to Juju, as an object like
  the following:
```javascript
{
  entities: []{
    tag: string
  }
}
```
- *@param {Function} callback* Called when the response from Juju is available,
  the callback receives an error and the result. If there are no errors, the
  result is provided as an object like the following:
```javascript
{
  results: []{
    error: {
      message: string,
      code: string,
      info: {
        macaroon: anything,
        macaroonPath: string
      }
    },
    address: string
  }
}
```
- *@returns {Promise}* Rejected or resolved with the values normally passed to
  the callback when the callback is not provided.
  This allows this method to be awaited.

## proxy(callback)
Proxy returns whether SSH connections should be proxied through the
    controller hosts for the model associated with the API connection.

- *@param {Function} callback* Called when the response from Juju is available,
  the callback receives an error and the result. If there are no errors, the
  result is provided as an object like the following:
```javascript
{
  useProxy: bool
}
```
- *@returns {Promise}* Rejected or resolved with the values normally passed to
  the callback when the callback is not provided.
  This allows this method to be awaited.

## publicAddress(args, callback)
PublicAddress reports the preferred public network address for one or more
    entities. Machines and units are suppored.

- *@param {Object} args* Arguments to be provided to Juju, as an object like
  the following:
```javascript
{
  entities: []{
    tag: string
  }
}
```
- *@param {Function} callback* Called when the response from Juju is available,
  the callback receives an error and the result. If there are no errors, the
  result is provided as an object like the following:
```javascript
{
  results: []{
    error: {
      message: string,
      code: string,
      info: {
        macaroon: anything,
        macaroonPath: string
      }
    },
    address: string
  }
}
```
- *@returns {Promise}* Rejected or resolved with the values normally passed to
  the callback when the callback is not provided.
  This allows this method to be awaited.

## publicKeys(args, callback)
PublicKeys returns the public SSH hosts for one or more entities. Machines
    and units are supported.

- *@param {Object} args* Arguments to be provided to Juju, as an object like
  the following:
```javascript
{
  entities: []{
    tag: string
  }
}
```
- *@param {Function} callback* Called when the response from Juju is available,
  the callback receives an error and the result. If there are no errors, the
  result is provided as an object like the following:
```javascript
{
  results: []{
    error: {
      message: string,
      code: string,
      info: {
        macaroon: anything,
        macaroonPath: string
      }
    },
    publicKeys: []string
  }
}
```
