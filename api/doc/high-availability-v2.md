# HighAvailability v2

HighAvailabilityAPI implements the HighAvailability interface and is the
  concrete implementation of the api end point.
This API facade is available on both controller and model connections.

To include HighAvailabilityV2 capabilities in your client, load it as
part of your facades, for instance:
```javascript
const {conn, logout} = await jujulib.connectAndLogin(url, credentials, {
  facades: [require('jujulib/api/facades/high-availability-v2')]
});
```
Facade methods at then accessible at `conn.facades.highAvailability`.

Go back to [index](index.md).

  the following:
```javascript
{
  specs: []{
    numControllers: int,
    constraints: {
      arch: string,
      container: string,
      cores: int,
      cpuPower: int,
      mem: int,
      rootDisk: int,
      tags: []string,
      instanceType: string,
      spaces: []string,
      virtType: string
    },
    series: string,
    placement: []string
  }
}
```
- *@param {Function} callback* Called when the response from Juju is available,
  the callback receives an error and the result. If there are no errors, the
  result is provided as an object like the following:
```javascript
{
  results: []{
    result: {
      added: []string,

    error: {
      message: string,
      code: string,
      info: {
        macaroon: anything,
        macaroonPath: string
      }
    }
  }
}
```
- *@returns {Promise}* Rejected or resolved with the values normally passed to
  the callback when the callback is not provided.
  This allows this method to be awaited.

## resumeHAReplicationAfterUpgrade(args, callback)
ResumeHAReplicationAfterUpgrade will add the upgraded members of HA cluster
    to the upgraded master.

- *@param {Object} args* Arguments to be provided to Juju, as an object like
  the following:

    id: int,
    address: string,
    priority: float,
    tags: map[string]string,
    votes: int
  }
}
```
- *@param {Function} callback* Called when the response from Juju is available,
  the callback receives an error or null if the operation succeeded.
- *@returns {Promise}* Rejected or resolved with the values normally passed to
  the callback when the callback is not provided.
  This allows this method to be awaited.

## stopHAReplicationForUpgrade(args, callback)
StopHAReplicationForUpgrade will prompt the HA cluster to enter upgrade
    mongo mode.

- *@param {Object} args* Arguments to be provided to Juju, as an object like
  the following:
```javascript
{
  target: {
    major: int,
    minor: int,
    patch: string,

```
- *@param {Function} callback* Called when the response from Juju is available,
  the callback receives an error and the result. If there are no errors, the
  result is provided as an object like the following:
```javascript
{
  rsMembers: []{
    id: int,
    address: string,
    priority: float,
    tags: map[string]string,

  },
  master: {
    tag: string,
    publicAddress: {
      value: string,

      scope: string,
      spacename: string,
      spaceproviderid: string
    },
    series: string
  },
  haMembers: []{
    tag: string,
    publicAddress: {
