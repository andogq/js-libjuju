# Payloads v1

API serves payload-specific API methods.
This API facade is available on model connections.

To include PayloadsV1 capabilities in your client, load it as
part of your facades, for instance:
```javascript
const {conn, logout} = await jujulib.connectAndLogin(url, credentials, {
  facades: [require('jujulib/api/facades/payloads-v1')]
});
```
Facade methods at then accessible at `conn.facades.payloads`.

Go back to [index](index.md).

## Methods
- [list](#listargs-callback)

## list(args, callback)
List builds the list of payloads being tracked for the given unit and IDs.
    If no IDs are provided then all tracked payloads for the unit are
    returned.

- *@param {Object} args* Arguments to be provided to Juju, as an object like
  the following:
```javascript
{
  patterns: []string
}
```
- *@param {Function} callback* Called when the response from Juju is available,
  the callback receives an error and the result. If there are no errors, the
  result is provided as an object like the following:
```javascript
{
  results: []{
    class: string,
    type: string,
    id: string,
    status: string,
    labels: []string,
    unit: string,
    machine: string
  }
}
```
- *@returns {Promise}* Rejected or resolved with the values normally passed to
  the callback when the callback is not provided.
  This allows this method to be awaited.
