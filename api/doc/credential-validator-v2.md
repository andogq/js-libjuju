# CredentialValidator v2

There is no documentation for this facade.
This API facade is available on model connections.

To include CredentialValidatorV2 capabilities in your client, load it as
part of your facades, for instance:
```javascript
const {conn, logout} = await jujulib.connectAndLogin(url, credentials, {
  facades: [require('jujulib/api/facades/credential-validator-v2')]
});
```
Facade methods at then accessible at `conn.facades.credentialValidator`.

Go back to [index](index.md).

## Methods
- [invalidateModelCredential](#invalidateModelCredentialargs-callback)
- [modelCredential](#modelCredentialcallback)
- [watchCredential](#watchCredentialargs-callback)
- [watchModelCredential](#watchModelCredentialcallback)

## invalidateModelCredential(args, callback)
InvalidateModelCredential marks the cloud credential for this model as
    invalid.

- *@param {Object} args* Arguments to be provided to Juju, as an object like
  the following:
```javascript
{
  reason: string
}
```
- *@param {Function} callback* Called when the response from Juju is available,
  the callback receives an error and the result. If there are no errors, the
  result is provided as an object like the following:
```javascript
{
  error: {
    message: string,
    code: string,
    info: {
      macaroon: anything,
      macaroonPath: string
    }
  }
}
```
- *@returns {Promise}* Rejected or resolved with the values normally passed to
  the callback when the callback is not provided.
  This allows this method to be awaited.

## modelCredential(callback)
ModelCredential returns cloud credential information for a  model.

- *@param {Function} callback* Called when the response from Juju is available,
  the callback receives an error and the result. If there are no errors, the
  result is provided as an object like the following:
```javascript
{
  modelTag: string,
  exists: bool,
  credentialTag: string,
  valid: bool
}
```
- *@returns {Promise}* Rejected or resolved with the values normally passed to
  the callback when the callback is not provided.
  This allows this method to be awaited.

## watchCredential(args, callback)
WatchCredential returns a NotifyWatcher that observes changes to a given
    cloud credential.

- *@param {Object} args* Arguments to be provided to Juju, as an object like
  the following:
```javascript
{
  tag: string
}
```
- *@param {Function} callback* Called when the response from Juju is available,
  the callback receives an error and the result. If there are no errors, the
  result is provided as an object like the following:
```javascript
{
  notifywatcherid: string,
  error: {
    message: string,
    code: string,
    info: {
      macaroon: anything,
      macaroonPath: string
    }
  }
}
```
- *@returns {Promise}* Rejected or resolved with the values normally passed to
  the callback when the callback is not provided.
  This allows this method to be awaited.

## watchModelCredential(callback)
WatchModelCredential returns a NotifyWatcher that watches what cloud

- *@param {Function} callback* Called when the response from Juju is available,
  the callback receives an error and the result. If there are no errors, the
  result is provided as an object like the following:
```javascript
{
  notifywatcherid: string,
  error: {
    message: string,
    code: string,
    info: {
      macaroon: anything,
      macaroonPath: string
    }
