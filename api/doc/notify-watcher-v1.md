# NotifyWatcher v1

srvNotifyWatcher defines the API access to methods on a state.NotifyWatcher.
  Each client has its own current set of watchers, stored in resources.
This API facade is available on both controller and model connections.

To include NotifyWatcherV1 capabilities in your client, load it as
part of your facades, for instance:
```javascript
const {conn, logout} = await jujulib.connectAndLogin(url, credentials, {
  facades: [require('jujulib/api/facades/notify-watcher-v1')]
});
```
Facade methods at then accessible at `conn.facades.notifyWatcher`.

Go back to [index](index.md).

## Methods
- [next](#nextcallback)
- [stop](#stopcallback)

## next(callback)
Next returns when a change has occurred to the entity being watched since
    the most recent call to Next or the Watch call that created the
    NotifyWatcher.

- *@param {Function} callback* Called when the response from Juju is available,
  the callback receives an error or null if the operation succeeded.
- *@returns {Promise}* Rejected or resolved with the values normally passed to
  the callback when the callback is not provided.
  This allows this method to be awaited.

## stop(callback)
Stop stops the watcher.

- *@param {Function} callback* Called when the response from Juju is available,
  the callback receives an error or null if the operation succeeded.
- *@returns {Promise}* Rejected or resolved with the values normally passed to
  the callback when the callback is not provided.
  This allows this method to be awaited.
